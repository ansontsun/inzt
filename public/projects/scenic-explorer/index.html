<meta name="description" content="Introduction
ScenicExplorer is an efficient mapping and navigation software that enables real-time interaction with all possible geographical data in OpenStreetMap format.
Written in C&#43;&#43;, it is smart, user-friendly, and ultimately, does its job right.
This application is developed as part of the design process for ECE297: Software Communication and Design, an rigorous course at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, in an industry-standard environment.
Features
Auto-Completion
Searching for places can be a pain, especially when people just want to explore. Auto-completion removes the need for users to memorize every single place they intend to search up by bringing up suggestions instantly once the user starts typing into the search bar. Fast and responsive, the suggestions change dynamically as the input changes over time.">
