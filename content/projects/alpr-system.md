# Overview
The Automated Licence Plate Recognition System (ALPR) is a machine-learning application that can recognize the text on vehicle license plates, from a give sample of image or video. An rigorous approach was taken to develop, train and optimize the models needed for this task.

Specifically, YOLOv10 and YOLOv8 were adapted and customized to perform object recognition on licence plates. EasyOCR is adapted and trained to recognize and output plaintext from captured licence plates.
